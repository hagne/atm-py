Size distribution
-----------------
atmPy size_distribution is the gateway to exploring and manipulating aerosol 
properties based on their size distribution. Size distributions are treated in three different representations: 
simple one dimensional (SizeDist), size distribution timeseries (SizeDist_TS),
or size distribution vertical profile (SizeDist_LS). The latter are a subclasses of the first and therefore inherit most properties, but in addition have tools specific to the representation. 
Explore the examples below to learn about some basics.
