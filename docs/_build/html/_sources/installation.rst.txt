Installation
------------

Dependencies
============
atmPy depends on many optional dependencies and it is not recommended to install
all of them due to inter-dependency issues that sometimes arise. It is recommended 
to simply install packages when they are missing as indicated by an error message.
As a minimum make sure to install:

* matplotlib
* scipy
* xarray

e.g. thru conda:
``conda install matplotlib scipy xarray``

Download and install atmPy
==========================
